# WebAutomatizationTutorial
Simple web automatization using Python and Selenium that reads a list of YouTube videos from a text file and then proceeds 
to download them using the onlinevideoconverter web page, then it redirects to Portal by PushBullet.

You're going to need to use Google Chrome (or modify the code accordingly).
Also: Remember to download Selenium's chromedriver
